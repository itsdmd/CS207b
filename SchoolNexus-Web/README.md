# SchoolNexus Web

> Code base for SchoolNexus's web client.

This project was scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)'s `react` template (JavaScript + SWC).

## Getting Started

Make sure you have a [SchoolNexus Server](https://github.com/itsdmd/CS207b/tree/main/SchoolNexus-Server) up and running. Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.

The default URL is `http://localhost:20700`. If you are running the server on a different address, change the value of `SERVER_URL` environment variable accordingly.

To get started, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The default port for the server is `20701`. Edit the `PORT` environment variable in `.env` as needed.
